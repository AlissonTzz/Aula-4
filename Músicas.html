                <li> Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now</li>
                <li> Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same</li>
                <li> When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down</li>
                <li> 'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name</li>
                    <br>
                <li> It all just sounds like, ooh</li>
                    <br>
                <li> Too young, too dumb to realize</li>
                <li> That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand</li>
                <li> Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance</li>
                <li> Take you to every party, 'cause all you wanted to do was dance</li>
                <li> Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man</li>
                    <br>
                <li> My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways</li>
                <li> Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life</li>
                <li> Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh</li>
                <li> And it haunts me every time I close my eyes</li>
                    <br>
                <li> It all just sounds like, ooh</li>
                    <br>
                <li> Too young, too dumb to realize</li>
                <li> That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand</li>
                <li> Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance</li>
                <li> Take you to every party, 'cause all you wanted to do was dance</li>
                <li> Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man</li>
                    <br>
                <li> Although it hurts</li>
                <li> I'll be the first to say that I was wrong</li>
                <li> Oh, I know I'm probably much too late</li>
                <li> To try and apologize for my mistakes</li>
                <li> But I just want you to know</li>
                    <br>
                <li> I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand</li>
                <li> Give you all his hours when he has the chance</li>
                <li> Take you to every party</li>
                <li> 'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance</li>
                    <br>
                <li> Do all the things I should've done</li>
                <li> When I was your man</li>
                <li> Do all the things I should've done</li>
                <li> When I was your man</li>

                <li> Loving can hurt</li>
                <li> Loving can hurt sometimes</li>
                <li> But it's the only thing that I know</li>
                <li> When it gets hard</li>
                <li> You know, it can get hard sometimes</li>
                <li> It is the only thing that makes us feel alive</li>
                <br>
                <li> We keep this love in a photograph</li>
                <li> We made these memories for ourselves</li>
                <li> Where our eyes are never closing</li>
                <li> Our hearts were never broken</li>
                <li> And time's forever frozen still</li>
                <br>
                <li> So, you can keep me</li>
                <li> Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans</li>
                <li> Holding me close until our eyes meet</li>
                <li> And you won't ever be alone</li>
                <li> Wait for me to come home</li>
                <br>
                <li> Loving can heal</li>
                <li> Loving can mend your soul</li>
                <li> And it's the only thing that I know, know</li>
                <li> I swear it will get easier</li>
                <li> Remember that with every piece of ya</li>
                <li> And is the only thing we take with us when we die</li>
                <br>
                <li> We keep this love in this photograph</li>
                <li> We made these memories for ourselves</li>
                <li> Where our eyes are never closing</li>
                <li> Our hearts were never broken</li>
                <li> Time's forever frozen still</li>
                <br>

                <li> Holding me close until our eyes meet</li>
                <li> And you won't ever be alone</li>
                <br>
                <li> And if you hurt me</li>
                <li> That's okay, baby</li>
                <li> Only words bleed</li>
                <li> Inside these pages you just hold me</li>
                <li> And I won't ever let you go</li>
                <li> Wait for me to come home</li>

                <li> Wait for me to come home</li>
                <br>
                <li> So you could fit me</li>
                <li> Inside the necklace you got</li>
                <li> When you were sixteen</li>
                <li> Next to your heartbeat, where I should be</li>
                <li> Keep it deep within your soul</li>
                <br>
                <li> And if you hurt me</li>
                <li> Well, that's okay, baby</li>
                <li> Only words bleed</li>
                <li> Inside these pages you just hold me</li>
                <li> And I won't ever let you go</li>
                <br>
                <li> When I'm away</li>
                <li> I will remember how you kissed me</li>
                <li> Under the lamppost back on 6th Street</li>
                <li> Hearing you whisper through the phone</li>
                <li> Wait for me to come home</li>
